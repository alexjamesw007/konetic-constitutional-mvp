- All projections require validated evidence
- Historical performance must be documented
- Benchmarks must be properly sourced

### ✅ Professional Business Standards
- Business optimization focus only
- Professional language maintained throughout
- Clear value articulation for all services
- Technical jargon avoided in client communications

### ✅ Quality Assurance Monitoring
